          <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Welcome to the World Cup 2030!</h2>
          <p > **Morocco, Portugal, and Spain officially designated as hosts of the 2030 FIFA World Cup** </p><br>

        <div class="article">
          <img class="eyit" src="le maroc.jpg" ><br> 
          <p class="text-left"> Morocco, Portugal, and Spain have been officially designated as hosts of the 2030 FIFA World Cup by the Congress of the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), which convened on Wednesday in an extraordinary session via videoconference.</p><br>      
          <p class="text-left"> During this session, chaired by FIFA President Gianni Infantino from Zurich, the Congress members also approved the allocation of the three centennial matches in 2030 to Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay, while Saudi Arabia was confirmed as the host nation for the 2034 World Cup.</p><br>  
          <p class="text-left">  The three bids were unanimously approved by the 211 FIFA member associations, who voted separately on the designation procedure adopted by FIFA and the respective bids.</p><br>
          <p class="text-left"> In a speech on this occasion, Mr. Infantino stated, "In today’s divided world (...) being able to agree on something like this represents an extraordinary message."</p><br>
          <p class="text-left"> "We live unity. We live inclusivity. We live football," he solemnly declared.</p><br>
          <p class="text-left"> For his part, the President of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa, expressed his gratitude to the FIFA member associations for making possible “this moment of shared happiness, a moment significant in many ways, starting with its universal representation, rarely seen or experienced in other domains.”</p><br>
          <p class="text-left"> "I thank you for placing your trust in my country, Morocco, and its two partners, Portugal and Spain, to jointly organize the 2030 FIFA World Cup," he said in a pre-recorded speech broadcast during the Congress.</p><br>
          <p class="text-left">"This trust placed in my country by selecting its bid as part of the tripartite candidacy once again reflects the progress made both in the preparations specific to the event and in the overall development of the country, guided by the enlightened vision of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God assist Him," Mr. Lekjaa emphasized.</p><br>
          <p class="text-left">"This will not only contribute to the successful organization of the event but also to the realization of what we have always advocated—that sport, in general, and football, in particular, serve as a lever for socio-economic and human development," he continued.</p><br>
          <p class="text-left">"The tripartite bid will secure a significant place in history. This is the first time this global event is being held simultaneously in Africa, the cradle of humanity, and on the Old Continent, Europe," concluded the FRMF President.</p><br>
          <p class="text-left"> Moreover, a representative from the independent auditor (BDO), tasked by FIFA with verifying the compliance of bids for the 2030 and 2034 World Cups, concluded that both bidding procedures were conducted with "objectivity, integrity, and transparency."</p><br>
          <p class="text-left"> As the sole candidate for the 2030 World Cup, the Morocco-Portugal-Spain bid, "Yalla Vamos 2030," achieved a major milestone at the end of November with the publication of FIFA's evaluation report. The report highlighted that this tripartite bid is characterized by "its overall quality" and exceeds "the minimum organizational requirements" specified in the technical evaluation, earning a score of 4.2 out of 5.</p><br>
          <p class="text-left">This strength is evident in the technical evaluation, which covers both infrastructure (sporting and otherwise) and commercial potential, as explained in the report.</p><br>
          <p class="text-left">The Morocco-Portugal-Spain 2030 bid proposes a diverse and appealing selection of stadiums, numbering 20 in total: six in Morocco, three in Portugal, and 11 in Spain. This surpasses the minimum requirements (14 stadiums) defined for the 2030 World Cup, offering enough flexibility to select iconic and diverse venues across the three countries. The report notes that stadiums such as Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid, Camp Nou in Barcelona, and the Grand Stade Hassan II in Casablanca have been proposed for the opening and final matches.</p><br>

                     <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">> Luis Figo : « Nous disposons des infrastructures, des <br>installations et de l’expertise nécessaires pour <br>accueillir un événement véritablement exceptionnel »</h3>
                     <img class="hello" src="bbb.webp" >
                     <p class="text-gray-600"><p>Any list of the greatest players of all-time is incomplete without the name Luís Figo. Renowned for his grace and skill, Figo showcased his talent in Portugal, Spain and Italy, for Sporting CP, Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Inter Milan. His incredible career saw him earn 127 caps for Portugal, the fourth highest in the team’s history, and included captaining the team to the final of EURO 2004 on home turf. </p><br>
                     <p> Figo won numerous prestigious titles throughout his career, including the Ballon d'Or in 2000 and the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2001. At club level, he won an astonishing eight league titles (four in Spain, four in Italy), as well as a host of cup competitions, including the UEFA Champions League in 2002. He was named Portuguese Footballer of the Year six consecutive times, from 1995-2000. </p><br>
                     
                     
                     <h2><p>*Q1: Luis, it’s great to have you with us. As we all know, you had an incredible career at a club and international level, in several countries. Can you start by sharing your experience playing in major clubs in Portugal, Spain, and Italy during your career? </p></h2> 
                     <p>A: Certainly, I have so many positive memories. Obviously, I grew up in Lisbon. I was part of Sporting CP’s academy from the age of 12, and breaking through to the first team was the source of immense pride. The atmosphere at Sporting CP was always electric, with fans deeply connected to their local clubs. </p><br>
                     <p>Moving to FC Barcelona was a tremendous opportunity for me to establish myself on the international stage. It was a very successful time for us, winning La Liga twice, at a very important moment for the club. My experience at Real Madrid was equally incredible. We had a great team, full of stars, and winning the UEFA Champions League trophy was particularly special for me. Finally, I will always remember my time with Inter Milan very fondly as well. They welcomed me as one of their own, and we also had tremendous success, winning the league each of the four seasons I was there.</p><br>
                     <p>Each experience at these four clubs was different, but there were some things in common – the passion for football, the sense of pride, and the beauty and culture of some of the best cities in the world.</p><br>
                     
                      
                     
                     <p>*Q2: You also of course represented Portugal for an incredible 18 years, starting from the U-16 team, before amassing 127 caps for the senior side. How do you reflect on your years playing for your country?</p><br> 
                     <p>There is nothing quite like representing your country on an international stage. I never took for granted the honour of putting on the Portugal jersey. As you mention, my experience started with the national team from young, when we were very successful, winning the U-16 European Championship and FIFA U-20 World Championships. It really felt like a breakthrough moment for football in Portugal.</p><br>
                     <p>Every match was special and an opportunity to defend the colours of my country, but of course the major championships, the European Championships and the FIFA World Cup™, hold a special significance. I was fortunate enough to play in three European Championships and two FIFA World Cups™, each one a unique occasion that will stay with me forever.</p><br>
                     
                      
                     
                     <p>*Q3: There are certainly not many players that can say they captained their team at a home international major competition. Though it did not end the way you wanted it to, how do you remember the feeling of representing Portugal at EURO 2004, and how the Portuguese people embraced it?   </p><br>                    
                     It was a unique moment in my career. Playing in front of a home crowd in such an important tournament is an unforgettable feeling. We felt a tremendous honour of representing 11 million people, and at the same time showcasing our country to the world as a host nation.</p><br>                    
                     International championships are built around fine margins, small moments. That is probably what makes them the best football events in the world. Though it didn’t end the way we wanted it to, I felt an enormous pride for the way that we competed, and the way that our country welcomed the whole of Europe. We showed that we are capable of hosting the biggest events in the world, and doing so in a friendly, welcoming fashion. </p>

                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg"> > Morocco, Portugal and Spain <br>submit Bid Book to FIFA for <br> Joint Bid for 2030 FIFA World <br> Cup</h3>
                    <img class="hey" src="ppp.webp" >
                    <p class="text-gray-600"><p>The joint bid of Morocco, Portugal and Spain to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup™ has reached a significant milestone, with the complete bid book being officially submitted to FIFA leadership at an event held today in FIFA’s Paris offices. </p> <br>
                    <p>  The official bid book was handed over to FIFA President Gianni Infantino by the Presidents of the three bidding Football Federations: Fouzi Lekjaa, President of the of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation, Fernando Gomes, President of the Portuguese Football Federation, and Álvaro de Miguel, General Secretary of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, on behalf of President Pedro Rocha. </p> <br>
                    <p>With the ambition of building a tournament ‘for football, for the world, for tomorrow’, the bid is driven by the slogan YallaVamos, symbolizing a proactive effort to advance the game globally. </p> <br>
                    <p>  Extensive engagement efforts have already been made throughout the campaign to promote this vision, with the bid having tens of thousands of followers in social media. </p> <br>
                    <p>  A successful bid would mark the first time the men’s FIFA World Cup™ is held across two continents in its 100-year history. To celebrate this, the bid emphasizes building bridges between cultures, offering a welcome environment to fans and visitors from all background, and leaving a true legacy in sustainability, innovation, investment and social impact. </p> <br>
                    <p>  The bid book, which comprehensively details the bid vision and technical planning, including transport, accommodation and security arrangements, also outlines the proposed host cities and stadiums for a 2030 FIFA World Cup™ in the three countries. </p> <br>
                    <p> The bid is supported by an impressive group of bid ambassadors, including footballing legends from each nation – Luis Figo, Andres Iniesta and Nourredine Naybet – and legend Emmanuel Adebayor, as well as leading players from the current men’s and women’s national teams: Cristiano Ronaldo, Achraf Hakimi, Dolores Silva, Ghizlane Chebbak, Alvaro Morata, Irene Paredes and Yassine Bounou. </p> <br>
                    <p>  The final decision for the host of the 2030 FIFA World Cup™ is due to be made by a vote of the FIFA Congress on the 11th of December 2024. </p> <br>
                    <p>  Upon receiving the official bid book for the joint bid of Morocco, Portugal and Spain, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said: "Your three countries have already given a lot to football, countries with great passion for the game, great organisational skills and a shared vision of what football and its values should be! It’s fantastic that you united two continents in the dream to organize the FIFA World Cup! Football Unites the World and you are proving it with this bid.” </p><br>
                    <p>   During the event in Paris, leaders of all three bidding Federations elaborated on the vision of their tripartite bid: </p><br>
                    <p>    Fouzi Lekjaa, the President of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation, stated: "We are proud and honoured to deliver such a historic bid for our three countries, in accordance with the vision of His Majesty King Mohammed VI. We are truly convinced that our bid will constitute a heritage for today's generations and a legacy for those of tomorrow. We want the 2030 FIFA World Cup™ to unite people from all over the world and make all Africans proud.” </p> <br>                      
                    <p>   Fernando Gomes, President of the Portuguese Football Federation, commented: “The bid book delivered here today anticipates an agenda for the future. This is a bid which includes environmental aspects as a structuring pillar of the event, a bid which combines the needs of the competition with the expectations of FIFA World Cup™ host cities, and a bid which promotes inclusion and diversity for all. This is the basis on which our entire proposal is based!” </p><br>     
                    <p>  On behalf of the President of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Pedro Rocha, the General Secretary of the Spanish Federation, Álvaro de Miguel, added: “42 years ago, our country organised its only FIFA World Cup™ to date – Spain 1982. Today, more than 40% of our population were not born when that happened. The FIFA World Cup 2030™ will unite those generations that lived through it and those that did not. And it will also unite three countries and two continents, leaving an intergenerational, international and intercontinental legacy,”</p> .</p>

                    <img class="hey" src="vamos.webp" >
                    <p class="text-gray-600"><p>The YallaVamos2030 Bid Committee for the 2030 FIFA World Cup™ have been conducting a series of progress meetings and site inspections over the past month, finalizing adjustments to the joint bid before the final submission to FIFA by the end of July. </p> <br>
                    <p>Among these was a productive meeting in Agadir on June 27-28, where the tripartite committee conducted a variety of working sessions to clarify points within the bid book. Online meetings have also been conducted with FIFA representatives, focusing on the bid process and its progress.</p> <br>
                    <p>The bid book resembles the key foundation of the YallaVamos bid, providing a detailed overview of the vision for the 2030 FIFA World Cup™, background information on the host countries and a clear indication of the political support that the bid has.</p> <br>
                    <p> Other, more technical aspects for the 2030 FIFA World Cup™ are also included, notably focusing on the proposed infrastructure and competition-related event sites, considerations for key services such as transport, accommodation and security, and an overview of commercial and legacy planning.</p> <br>
                    <p> With such a wealth of information, bid representatives from Morocco, Portugal and Spain have been working more closely than ever, enacting the ideals of the bid to unite people based on their love for football. Should the YallaVamos bid be successful, it would be the first ever men’s FIFA World Cup™ to be held across continents, making it truly historic.</p> <br>
                    <p> To celebrate this key milestone, the bid book has embarked on a thrilling road trip across the bidding countries, from the Royal Moroccan Football Federation to the Portuguese Football Federation and finally to the Royal Spanish Football Federation. The road trip campaign highlights the beauty of the three countries, the ease of travel between them, and of course the passion for football that is everywhere to be seen.</p>
